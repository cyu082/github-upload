Stocism and what it is:
- Visualize a medocre or bad ending. That way you are never disapointed.
- Staying calm and rational in dire situations and analize what is happening around you.
- Turn things into a different perspective (we had an argument in discord so this gives me experience in the future dealing with arugments and how to handle them proffesionally).
- Don't let emotions interfere with your desision. Choose what is most rational and logical.
- Treating others with fairness even if they have done something bad.
- Courage to face your problem instead of running away from it.

I had an odd experience earlier this morning where an argument between my friends broke out. 

One of my closer friends was banned twice, one time as a joke and then the other time, he said stop but they did it anyways. 

He got reinvited and was mad at the person who banned him but, nearly everyone was against him. 

This friend that got banned was more of an annoying type of friend and he had a history with being really annoying which made nearly everyone biased against him. 

From there, he went to me and another friend and explained this case and we discussed about it. Now it has died down quite a bit now but I feel like there were principals of stocism in there unironically.

I wanted to visualize that everything would be better but that does not always happen.
I also didn't want to side with emotions because that would influence how I would take this situation.
I also didn't look at this situation in a negative way and looked at it in a more positive way as I can have experience in the future with dealing with arguements.
